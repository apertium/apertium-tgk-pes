This is just my pad for creating xmls in script. I don't like to change xml by hand in the cases I make these lousy tools.

ods file contains sheets and more data for me

Wait for better tools- This is just for me

Breaking verb prefixes into two groups
#The ones can join the verb like be na(Some or all of these prefixes must join-> I'll think)*NO SPACE IS ALLOWED AND USED ANYWAY*
#Ones can't join like mi
*After these both prefix should be defined for all verbs 
*#for most of the verbs those groups can be used together(especially it is found redundantly in older texts)
*#for verbs begining with a/e/aa/o/u we should take more care and make the paradigms seperatedly(*NO SPACE IS ALLOWED AND USED ANYWAY* shouldn't be forgotten)
*#mi always need need space


NOW TODO
*paradigm for all verbs:
**simple single rooted verbs will be deleted
**All verbs need definition in paradigm part
**3 form(past/pres/imp) -> imp doesn't take some prefix likes me
**for aa begining both with a (for joining prefix form) and aa for non-joining prefix form is required. Joining forms need a kind of paradigm that doesn't have path trough so making a P_jprefixes P_njprefixes to be used with path through in P_prefixes is a good practice
