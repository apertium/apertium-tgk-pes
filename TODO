== Dictionaries TODO ==

* Make for fa-tg.tg.metadix

* To check all noun paradigms for existence of ZWNJ

* To change all irregular Arabic plurals and remove the exceptions from standard section

* In the persian dictionary, make sure that possessive suffixes work on nouns

* Check the bilingual dictionary entries to make sure that Tajik words are correctly spelt, e.g. 

        <e><p><l>тоҷек<s n="np"/></l><r>تاجیک<s n="np"/></r></p></e>

* In the bilingual dictionary, proper nouns on the Tajik side should probably have capital letters.
